Jquery is a library used to manipulate HTML

it works off of events, mouse over, click etc.
it can make requests from other websites

all of jquery is javascript.  It is another layer of javascript.
it has its own layer of processing and its own syntax grammar and rules

what is a DOM.  The document Obeject Model.
the dom is what the user sees.

document
HTML
head
scripts go here
links go here
head
body
all the other fun tags with parents and their children.
body
html

CDN is a content delivery network. 'I don't have a copy of it go to the internet
and get me a copy of it'
dont use that unless you have to.  Its better to have your own copy of jquery.

jquery can do stuff when the dom is finished loading
jquery can do stuff after an event happens.

gotta have $() to select something with jquery.  something to watch or something to monitor.

.ready(), .onclick()... . then a thing then()  means when this happens do (this)

$hey jquery(when this).does this(do this)

document ready is important because you cant change the dom until it exists.  it needs to load first.

you re going to this a lot!!!:

$(document).ready(handleReady)

function handleReady(){
console.log('DOM is ready');
}

Jquery uses selectors the same way that CSS does.  you can select by id or class or elements
$('#some-id')
$('.some-class')
$('li')
$('li a')
$('.mic', '.check')

these selectors return an Obeject to you!!! 

you can navigate as well this is called method chaining

$('li').parent();
$('ul').children().first();

.append crates a new element at the end of your selector!!!!!
.preppend puts it on the front!!

the word this in jquery is the word originator
